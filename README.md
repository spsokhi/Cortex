Cortex is a **privacy-first desktop AI assistant** that runs entirely on your machine. No API keys, no subscriptions, no data leaving your device — ever.

- Chat with any local LLM via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)
- Switch between 14 AI personas (Coding Assistant, Interview Coach, Debate Partner, and more)
- Ask questions about your own documents (RAG) — supports PDF, TXT, Markdown, and code files
- Write and preview Markdown notes
- Get coding help with starter prompts
- Manage and download models from within the app
- Export conversations as Markdown
- Light and dark theme

---

## Prerequisites

Install these before anything else:

| Tool | Version | Download |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 20+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **pnpm** | 9+ | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| **Rust** | 1.77+ | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| **Ollama** | Latest | [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) |

> **Windows users:** After installing Rust, restart your terminal so `cargo` is on your PATH.

---

## Setup

### 1 — Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spsokhi/Cortex.git
cd Cortex
```

### 2 — Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

If prompted about native packages, approve them:

```bash
pnpm approve-builds
```

### 3 — Start Ollama

Ollama must be running in the background before you launch Cortex.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
ollama serve

# Windows — Ollama runs automatically after installation.
# If not, open the Ollama app from the Start Menu or run:
ollama serve
```

### 4 — Pull a model

```bash
# Recommended — fast and capable (~2.0 GB)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Larger, higher quality (~4.7 GB)
ollama pull llama3:8b

# Smallest, great for low-RAM machines (~1.3 GB)
ollama pull phi3:mini

# For document Q&A (RAG) — embedding model (~274 MB)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

> You can also download models from inside the app under the **Models** tab.

### 5 — Run Cortex

```bash
pnpm tauri:dev
```

The app window will open. First build takes 2–5 minutes (Rust compiles). Subsequent starts are fast.

## What you can do

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Chat** | Talk to your local AI. Switch personas, enable RAG, export conversations, regenerate responses. |
| **Files** | Upload PDF, TXT, Markdown, or code files. Enable **RAG** in chat to ask questions about them. |
| **Code** | Coding-focused starter prompts that open pre-filled in Chat. |
| **Models** | Browse, download, and switch between any Ollama model. |
| **Notes** | Write Markdown notes. Auto-saved locally. Toggle Preview mode. |
| **Settings** | Adjust theme, appearance, chat behaviour, and privacy options. |

---

## AI Personas

Cortex includes 14 built-in personas — each one shapes how the AI thinks, speaks, and responds. Select a persona from the sidebar before starting a new chat.

| Persona | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| ⚡ **Coding Assistant** | Clean code, best practices, explains design decisions |
| 🔍 **Debug Detective** | Systematic root-cause analysis, not just quick fixes |
| ⚔️ **Debate Partner** | Challenges your assumptions, steelmans opposing views |
| 🎓 **Study Buddy** | Patient, step-by-step explanations with analogies |
| 🤔 **Socratic Tutor** | Teaches entirely through questions — never just gives answers |
| ✍️ **Creative Writer** | Stories, brainstorming, character development, prose editing |
| 🔬 **Research Analyst** | Rigorous, structured, distinguishes fact from uncertainty |
| 🚀 **Startup Advisor** | Direct strategy advice — product-market fit, growth, leverage |
| 🌟 **Life Coach** | Goal clarity, accountability, actionable next steps |
| 😈 **Devil's Advocate** | Finds every risk and failure mode in your plan |
| 🌍 **Language Tutor** | Conversational practice, grammar correction, natural phrasing |
| 🍳 **Chef & Food Guide** | Recipes, cooking techniques, substitutions, pairings |
| 🧘 **Mindful Listener** | Empathetic, non-judgmental space for reflection |
| 💼 **Interview Coach** | Mock interviews, STAR framework, honest feedback |

**How to use:**
1. Open the sidebar (expand if collapsed)
2. Click any persona in the **Persona** section
3. Click **New Chat** — the persona's system prompt is automatically injected
4. Chat as normal — the AI will behave according to the persona

> Switching personas does not affect existing conversations. Set it to **No Persona** to return to default AI behavior.

---

## Using RAG (document Q&A)

1. Pull the embedding model once: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
2. Go to **Files** → upload a `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`, or code file → wait for **Indexed** status (files show a **semantic** badge when embeddings are built)
3. Go to **Chat** → click the **database icon** in the input toolbar to enable RAG
4. Ask a question — Cortex embeds your query, finds the most relevant passages by semantic similarity, and injects them into the prompt. Each answer lists its **sources** (click to expand)

Retrieval is semantic (embeddings via Ollama, cosine similarity) with a keyword fallback for files indexed without embeddings — use the **re-index** button on a file card to upgrade older files. PDF text is extracted automatically. All processing happens locally.

---

## Voice input (local Whisper)

Voice input transcribes on your machine via the bundled Whisper microservice — audio never leaves your device.

```bash
# One-time setup
pip install -r services/whisper/requirements.txt

# Start the service (keeps running in a terminal)
pnpm service:whisper
```

Then click the **mic icon** in the chat input: click to record, click again to stop and transcribe. The Whisper model (default `base`, ~142 MB) downloads automatically on first use; set `WHISPER_MODEL=small` (or `tiny`/`medium`/`large-v3`) before starting the service to change it.

> Prefer not to run the service? Settings → Voice lets you switch to the **Browser (cloud)** engine, which uses the Web Speech API — be aware it sends audio to your browser vendor's servers.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | New line in message |
| `Ctrl+K` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl+N` | New conversation |

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Desktop shell | [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) + Rust |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| State | Zustand (persisted to localStorage) |
| LLM runtime | [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) (local HTTP) |
| PDF parsing | pdfjs-dist (browser-side) |
| Build | Vite 5, pnpm |
